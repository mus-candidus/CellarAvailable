**CellarAvailable** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which makes the cellar available for any farm house size.

Configuration options supported in *config.json*:

* ShowCommunityUpgrade - Show community upgrade in the carpenter's RemoveCasks menu. This disables the upgrade option of your farm house so don't set it before you're satisfied with your house size.
* RemoveCasks - Removes all casks from your cellar. Note that this option resets itself, otherwise casks would being removed on every game start.
