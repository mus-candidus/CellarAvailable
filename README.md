**CellarAvailable** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which makes the cellar available for any farm house size.

Configuration option supported in *config.json*:

* ShowCommunityUpgrade - Show community upgrade in the carpenter's menu. This disables the upgrade option of your farm house so don't set it before you're satisfied with your house size.
